Things that really matter to me, on Monday, December 22nd, 2014.

If I had the choice, right now, to choose exactly how I wanted to live
for the next few years, what would I choose?

It's very hard to define the purpose of life, so instead I'll start by
defining what the purpose is not.

If the goal of life is not to be successful...
not to prove you are successful...
not to be more successful than someone else...
not to have power or influence…
not to ensure my place in another world in the future…

Then what is the goal of life?

Not having people hear my music...
not to read my writing...
not to use my software...
not to leave a legacy…
not to think how smart I am, that I found a way to not work and be a
slave to the system!

Any clue yet? 

The goal that I have for MYself for MY life...there's a lot of
selfishness that could come out of that, or it could be turned around.

If life could be free of stress, problems, worry, violence, hunger...if
living includes being a part of a community, able to seek and gain
wisdom and improve health over time...then that would be a good life.

What if the ideal life is making sure others are set up to also have
this good life? Where others have their basic needs met, and then maybe
they can contemplate 'what is the ideal life, and how can I set about
living it?'

Think how amazing that is, that right now, I have the opportunity to
think, 'what is the ideal life, and how do I live it?' When in history
has a human had that opportunity? Most of the time throughout history
it's been 'work today, or don't eat tomorrow!' But now, with our
advances in technology (first it was agriculture, then solid housing,
now maybe it's the internet...), we yet again are gifted with the chance
to contemplate life, if we choose to. But, we have had this chance in
the past too, if you have been willing to forgo certain luxuries to have
the luxury to analyze, to contemplate. Look at Thoreau, at Buddha.
Usually everything we need is already there for us, provided by the
great Earth ( some would call it God ). If everything we need wasn't
here, well, we probably wouldn't have gotten this far! Just look at how
the birds, the squirrels, the fish, as they go about their day. They
find what's there for them, take what they need, then the next day,
rinse and repeat.

So, I've got this opportunity to contemplate, and I am taking it. I
could be working the job that I am supposed to be doing. I'd like to
contemplate more. It seems that time spent contemplating is inversely
related to time spent working...hmmm...  

Now if one thing is certain, it's that if more people could contemplate
life, the world would be a better place. How did I get this chance to
contemplate in the middle of a busy work day in modern America? Well,
I'm working remotely! Glorious, isn't it? That a company would have
their employees choose where they work, so that their quality of life
might be better. Really a landmark in our civilization.  Agriculture,
solid housing, electricity, the internet, working remotely. But don't
overdo it, or take this freedom for granted. The same will happen with
remote-work as it would if you took agriculture as far is it could go (
clear cutting forests, GMOs...it can get out of hand! )

Back to the idea of The Ideal Life and making sure others are set up
with a Good Life:
If I could help someone forget their problems
to get into a positive space
to drive out darkness in their lives
this is living for others. 

Living for others is making an impact. This is important. Earning
another house, car, iphone, that is not important. As I've said, I've
already got what I need.

Every chance I get, when I'm in a good state of mind, to allow others a
Good Life, I hope I take it. First I hope I realize the opportunity I
have been presented...lighting another's candle of hope! Then I hope I
use the opportunity, to the best of my ability, without pride or ego.

Ok let's make a list for my detailed Good Life ( I'm starting to
differentiate between Good, for myself, and Ideal, where I can help
others achieve Good ).

Small, selfish things (not necessarily bad selfish - just things for my
own life):

1) Minimal Driving of automobiles
- cars contribute to a fast, selfish lifestyle. Long term pain for
short term gain. Are you alright supporting global warming? Drilling
for oil? Car payments? Road kill? Commuting? Lack of community
self-sufficiency? Road Rage? DUIs? No thanks.

2) Bike / energy efficient transport
- because you gotta get around, it's exercise, it's slowing
down, it's using technology efficiently. Biking could really
change the world! Critical mass folks. Instead of flicking off
your fellow biker, you give them a head nod and a hello, how are
you? Imagine a driver doing that at a red light! #BellsNotHorns

3) time to contemplate
4) time to read
5) time to appreciate my surroundings
6) time to explore spirituality
7) time to connect to history, culture
8) Exercise daily
- keep the body strong, capable and ready

9) Use natural products. Homemade / locally made
- minimal [chemicals, shipping, new items with
packaging]

10) contribute to a community 
- food / goods / skills so I can feel useful and
connect with people / processes that intersect with
my life

11) Consume no meat. 
- my reasons: 
- to live non-violently, we should not
create violence
- do not bring harm to sentient
beings if it's not 100%
necessary. ( plants count too i
guess...do not needlessly
harvest food if it will not be
used ).
- gain sustenance in the
most efficient way (
lowest water usage,
energy used in
production )
- flow with how
our bodies are
designed (
fingers not
claws, grinding
teeth not razor
sharp teeth,
stomach not made
for digesting
rotting flesh)

12) Consume only
ethical animal
products 
- dairy,
eggs,
clothing 

13) Produce
minimal
waste that
is not
organic.
- reduce
packaging,
purchase
of new
items
- try
to
compost
human
waste

14)
Use
minimal
dirty
energy
- replace
with
solar
/
water
/
wind

15)
Eat
organic,
local,
real
food
- nothing
[artificial,
shipped
in,
out
of
season,
GMO,
sprayed
with
chemicals]

16)
Surround
myself
with
inspiring
people
who
can
help
me,
and
I
can
help
them.
- this
lifestyle
isn't
the
easiest.
These
ideas
need
refining.
They
could
spread
if
they
are
presented
correctly.
That
would
be
a
good
thing.

17)
Have
alone
time
when
needed.
- to
do
things
like
contemplate
on
all
of
this.

18)
Directly
contribute
to
producing
mt
food,
shelter,
and
other
necessities.
- satisfy
our
need
to
be
useful,
have
a
skill.
Possibly
after
meditating
more
on
what's
important
/
getting
rid
of
ego
and
pride,
the
need
to
contribute
won’t
be
that
great.

19)
Have
a
complete
cycle
of
produce,
consume,
reuse,
in
all
aspects
of
life: 
a)
food
(
most
obviously
), 
b)
energy, 
c)
friendship, 
d)
community, 
e)
enjoying
the
earth.
- reap
what
we
sow

Notice,
as
I
am
noticing,
that
I
did
not
say
family.
I
love
my
family,
and
my
friends.
I
didn't
mention
the
word
love
either,
or
anything
about
being
near
a
hospital.
Because,
I've
never
been
without
love,
family,
or
nearby
healthcare,
I
possibly
don't
see
the
immense
value
in
those
things.
I
do
love
and
want
to
be
loved,
like
everyone.
I
do
care
about
family,
like
everyone,
and
don't
want
to
be
down
and
out
when
I'm
sick,
like
everyone.
I'm
just
not
afraid
of
those
things
going
away
at
this
point
in
time.
Lucky
me
I
guess...

Actually,
I'll
add
one
more
criteria
to
living
The
Good
Life:
not
having
fear.

Do
I
want
to
have
a
family
of
my
own
in
my
ideal
life?
Sure,
well...actually
I'm
not
sure...a
child
means
an
heir,
passing
on
my
bloodline
and
my
name,
making
my
parents
proud
that
they
now
have
a
grandchild.
Those
are
things
I
see
as
reasons
for
having
children,
and
I
don't
agree
with
those
reasons.
I'm
sure
it's
immensely
satisfying
to
have
a
child
grow
up
and
be
sort
of
like
you,
or
not...In
previous
times,
it
was
necessary
to
have
a
big
family
to
work
the
family
business.
More
people
meant
more
hands
meant
more
sustenance
and
security.
More
money
means
less
fear.
Too
much
money
leads
to
greed
and
confusion...sometimes.

Instead
of
having
my
own
biological
family,
I
would
be
perfectly
fine
with
adoption,
or
just
a
close-knit
community
/
group
of
friends
that
supports
each
other
like
family.
That's
a
different
topic
altogether...

Ok,
so
those
are
IDEALS.
That's
not
all
going
to
happen
today,
but
it's
something
I
could
work
towards.
Maybe
I'll
print
this
out
to
remind
me
of
what
I
have
agreed
upon
with
myself
is
important,
is
desired
in
my
life.
Maybe
more
importantly
are
recognizing
the
things
that
are
not
important.

I
want
to
follow
up
later
with
a
few
more
prompts:

1)
What
does
my
current
situation
allow
ouve
a
big
family
to
work
the
family
business.
More
people
meant
more
hands
meant
more
sustenance
and
security.
More
money
means
less
fear.
Too
much
money
leads
to
greed
and
confusion...sometimes.

Instead
of
having
my
own
biolte
own
biological
family,
I
would
be
perfectly
fine
with
adoption,
or
just
a
close-knit
community
/
group
of
friends
that
supports
each
other
like
family.
That's

Ok,
so
those
are
IDEAattion,
