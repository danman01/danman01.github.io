Well folks, turns out that I like to sleep between the hours of 1am and
8am.  But seriously, I tried to have alarms set at 1:35am, 5:35am, and 9:35am,
and sometimes they just were not set! Something about how the
subconcious either doesn't set an alarm or I will wake up and switch
them off before realizing what I'm doing.  

One issue I take thus far with Uberman sleep scheduling is just that -
scheduling.  Living and dying by the phone alarm is putting a lot of
trust into the device.  I don't like phones and wish we all tossed them
into traffic, so having to constantly rely on 6 alarms a day is a little
annoying.

So day one (Sunday) was a normal uberman day, with attempted naps
throughout. Day two (Monday) found me sleeping from around 5am to 8:30am,
then getting up and attempting the uberman nap schedule for the rest of
the day.  Day 3 (Tuesday), I had a job interview, so purposefully slept
for 4 hours from around 5 till 9.  I felt fantastic after four hours of
sleep, which is crazy to say.  Day 4 (Wednesday), I accidentally switched
my alarm off or something, and ended up sleeping about 6 hours from
around 1am to 7am.  Day 5 (Thursday), I did the same thing. I don't
think I set the days correctly or something on my alarm, and nothing
went off to get me up around 5:30, and I definitely just slept through
the 1:30am one. Same thing for day 6 (Friday), I somehow negotiated with
my subconscious to get a good 6 hours of sleep in.  Felt the most energy
at the moment of awaking today that I've had all week, which isn't surprising.

But I'm determined!  It's Friday, I'm going to a hackathon this weekend
(24 hours of coding), and I've got two weeks before I start a job (March
3rd).  I can definitely get adjusted before then to polyphasic sleeping.
I can't wait to regain the night. But I also think there will be a time
when I just want to sleep for a while.  Always taking naps for just 30
minutes seems like you never get to veg out. [Puredoxyk's blog](http://www.puredoxyk.com/index.php/2006/06/22/things-you-can-do-to-avoid-oversleeping/) lists tips for not oversleeping, which include NOT using a blanket, NOT sleeping on your bed, keeping the lights on, and if necessary dumping cold water on yourself accidentally as you turn off the alarm(s).

I would definitely miss falling asleep watching Lost
with a bowl of half eaten popcorn on the bedside table, then waking up 10 hours later to a
lazy morning with more Lost. And banana pancakes. Yea...

Note I originally called it polyphonic sleeping, which would drive me
mad to have the polyphonic spree playing while I was trying to sleep.
