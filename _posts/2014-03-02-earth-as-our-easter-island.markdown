The Rapa Nui died at their own hands, after having come to value big statues with giant heads more than the land, plants and animals upon which they depended. the humans of easter island died of a fatal case of disconnectedness. They failed to connect their own behaviors and the consequences they brought about. And by failing to honor and appreciate that which sustained their lives, they died.

On the shrinking island we call planet earth, we are now 7 billion Rapa Nui.  As we grow in material wealth, as the forests around us are disappearing, and as the animals we depend on are dying off, it would be wise to recall the lessons of easter island. If we fail to do so, well, we can predict the outcome.
