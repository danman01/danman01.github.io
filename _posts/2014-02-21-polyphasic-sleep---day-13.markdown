###Captain's log: Day 13
*Monday, Feb 21tst, 5:38am*

Today I'll be expounding upon my adventures in [Polyphasic sleeping](/sleep/2014/02/10/polyphasic-sleeping-begins.html). You may be wondering...what happened to days 5 through 12? Well they
came and went, and now I'm at day 13. Deal with it.

I've grown accustomed to sleeping on the couch at Betaspring a few times
throughout the day and night.  I'm in the habit of returning to my house to fix a meal to pack up and hold me over for the next day or so, grab a shower, change clothes, hit up the yoga class up the street. But for the most part, I've been at Betaspring (which is a 24 hour accessible co-working / startup hangout space).  

I never can seem to get all my naps in or fall
asleep the appropriate amount of times as requested by the Uberman
schedule, especially when there's people chatting and walking around circa the 1pm or 5pm nap.  Still, I find it helpful to schedule a 30-40 minute "try to
nap or at least calm the mind and relax" period every 4 to 5 hours.  The
body naturally makes up for missed naps and sleep by sneaking in an
additional hour or two once a day, or maybe 2 to 3 hours every 2nd or
3rd day of Uberman.  

I welcome the "errors" (oversleeping) in the uberman schedule, as
they leave me refreshed and energized beyond what I usually feel.  Will
that push back my adaptation? Probably.  Am I adapted now? I don't think
so.  I still feel groggy for at least one cycle of awake time between
naps. Usually it's around 2am - 5am.  I am getting better at jumping up
from a partial or wasted attempt at a nap and powering through to the
next one.  I realize this schedule is not forgiving.  If the workday
requires attention from 8am until 6pm, then that's what will have to
happen.  A day like that will be accompanied with a solid 3 hour sleep
likely later in the evening.  In the end, it seems to balance itself
out.  I've even found myself waking up without an alarm before a 30-40 min nap
is scheduled to be over. Ok that happened once.  Other times if I turn off the alarm and go back
to sleep, I awake within a reasonable amount of time (another hour or
so) without an alarm (that's happened ~ 6 times).  What I thought would happen if I turn of the
alarm, is I would enter a 10 hour zombie slumber that
puts me back to ground zero in the polyphasic adaptation. But that
hasn't happened yet. In the past 13 days, I haven't slept for more than
3 1/2 hours consecutively. Pretty cool!

I'm not really sticking to the strict Uberman schedule.  I am also not
changing over to the Everyman (3-4 hour core sleep and a few naps
throughout the day).  I am calling my cycle the Dannyman - it's what my
body / mind tells me to do while striving for Uberman.  Maybe
I'll oversleep for an hour a day. Maybe a 30 minute nap will stretch itself into 3 hours every 2-3 days.
I'm not going to be too strict with it. The important thing is to feel
good and not beat yourself up over it.

Is it getting easier? Yes. In fact, it never was that difficult for me.
If your job / relationship / responsibilities allow it, this shouldn't
be that difficult to try out for a little while.  

I'm starting a new job in a week and a half, and I mentioned to the CEO
during one of our meetings that I'm trying this ridiculous sleep schedule. They
have a long couch in a quiet room.  I will make it my awkward resting
period during the workday.  Can the Dannyman survive a change in employment / lifestyle? That will be the real test (in multiple ways).

So what am I doing with all my extra time? This is what invigorates me to keep the cycle going: there's an extra 3-4 hours to do whatever you want.  

I've been reading about twice as much as normal. I've been exercising about the same amount: a combined ~
40 minute bikeride each day, a yoga session every 3rd day or so (I will get
that back to every day, hopefully).  I've been eating about the same
amount, but have more time to spread the food out around the clock:
smaller portions and more meals.  Usually something small between each
awake period, and something medium once or twice a day.

I've been keeping up with writing, some on this blog, some one [Year
Without Plastic](http://yearwithoutplastic.wordpress.com).  

I've started a [$5 startup](http://www.quora.com/Steve-McGarry-1/Hack-and-Hustle/The-Five-Dollar-Startup) journal and am working on a few business ideas
a little bit each day: one is [MatchGogo](http://www.matchgogo.com),
an open ended survey creation and matching tool that uses the OK Cupid
algorithm to match your desired responses with those responses coming
in.  Another is [Home Compare Tool](http://homecomparetool.com), an
organizational tool for people looking to buy a home.  Allows distance calculations, list based comparisons, and sharing of properties someone is looking at buying.

Another idea I'm working on is building a chocolate loving
community (hey, why not?) appropriately called [Chocolate For
Dinner](http://facebook.com/chocolatefordinner) on Facebook and
[Eat More Chocolate](http://twitter.com/eatmorechocolate) on Twitter.
The goal there is find delicious images, awesome recipes, humorous and
thought provoking blurbs, thoughts, facts about Chocolate, and one day
maybe I'll monetize the group with awesome t-shirts or chocolate product
ads. Who doesn't want a chocolate themed t=shirt or chocolate related
ads appearing every now and then? I for one think that every t-shirt and
ad should depict something awesome / funny / tempting about chocolate.  

This schedule is perfect for attending hackathons. It gives you the ability to seemingly stay awake during
long stretches of time.  While everyone else turns into a zombie, I will
be normally going about in my usual routine.  

Also perfect for travelling across
the world.  No more jet lag! Unfortunately I've yet to try this out, but will be
taking a cross country trip next week. A 3 hour time difference wouldn't
affect me normally anyways, though.  I need to test it by travelling to
Australia or something. 

Also great for solo trips sailing around the world, covert spy missions,
and running your own 24 hour cafe / diner.

I also have time to keep up with [Bundio](https://bundio.com), with my freelancing work, help out
[MusicTown](http://musictown.co) with their new website (will be ready
in a few weeks), and respond to emails lightning fast very early in the
morning.  Needless to say, I feel like one of those 35 year old CEO
types that wakes up at 4am to hit the gym before crushing it at work,
and finally blogging about their fast paced lifestyle that only they can
maintain. It's a good feeling! But seriously, everyone should try
polyphasic sleeping.  Take back the night. Take back the pre-dawn hours.
Take back every hour during the day because you definitely won't be
sleeping through any of it. And then write a blog about it, and we can
cross reference each other and exchange emails and texts at 4am.
Please. Just try it...please...I am so lonely....
